# Changes to the Marlin firmware for Parallel Dual Extrusion

This repo has a version of Marlin that we adapted for our project
on parallel / simultaneous dual extrusion. Details are in our SFF 2021 [paper](http://utw10945.utweb.utexas.edu/sites/default/files/2021/101%20A%20Roadmap%20towards%20s%20Parallel%20Printing%20for%20Desktop%20.pdf).

The files that have changed:
